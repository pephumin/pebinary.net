These are the surveys that you can take. These surveys can be private to you, or a group you're in, or they can be public surveys.

If you have at least one survey available, you'll see a table listing the title, status, and last access data for all your available surveys. If you do not have any surveys available, you'll see a message indicating such.

The survey title is a link: follow those links to take each survey. The survey status indicates how you have, so far, interacted with the survey:

![Dashboard Screen][dashboard-screen]

- Not Started: You have not yet submitted a response to this survey. You may have looked at the survey, but you haven't submitted any responses. You may start this survey at any time.

- Started, but Incomplete: You have started this survey, but left early and saved your responses. You may return to this survey at any time. This status is only available if the survey administrator allows you to save your responses to return to later.

- Some Finished, some Incomplete: You have submitted at least one complete response, but have saved another for later. This status is only available for surveys that allow you to respond multiple times.

- Finished: You have submitted at least one complete response to this survey.

The last access column indicates when you last visited the survey.
