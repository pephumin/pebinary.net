### <i class="pe-anchor pe-fw"></i> The answer

This section shows the summary of points you have collected so far. It shows the accumulative points in different views including life-time, within this year, etc. And you will be able to see your current level and the gap before you will reach to the next level.

#### Detailed information

These are the surveys that you have had access to at one time, but the survey administrator has closed further access to them. Because these surveys are closed, you can no longer submit responses to them.

Like My Surveys, My History lists the survey title, status, and last access date.
