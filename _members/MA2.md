## Member registration

If allowed by your survey administrator, you may create a new account by clicking on the "Don't have an account? Sign up" link in the lower right hand corner of the login box. You will be prompted for your name, email address, desired user ID and password. If the requested user ID is available, your account will be created and you can log in using the given user ID and password.

However, please note: your survey administrator may need to give you access to additional surveys after you create your new account. If, after logging in, you don't see the surveys you expect, contact your survey administrator for further assistance.
