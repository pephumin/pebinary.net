You can create a new membership account by clicking on the `Sign up` menu.

You will be prompted for your name, email address, and the desired password. If the requested user email is not registered in our database, your account will then be created which will allow you to log in using your email address and password.


The process itself is very straightforward, and therefore expect no mistakes for registering new account except on the fact that particular user is already registered in our system. If this is a case, just simply use the `Password recovery` function to reset your password.

***However, please note: your survey administrator may need to give you access to additional surveys after you create your new account. If, after logging in, you don't see the surveys you expect, contact your survey administrator for further assistance.***
