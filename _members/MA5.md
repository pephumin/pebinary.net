## Public surveys

If your survey administrator has created public surveys (which do not require you to log in to take) and wants them to be shown, then they are available in the box labeled "Public Surveys." Simply click on any of the links to take that survey.

If you have an account, we recommend you log in before taking any public surveys. Once you log in, you will have the opportunity to take the public surveys. By logging in first, your responses to the public survey will be identified as yours, which will then appear in your survey history (more on your survey history, below).
