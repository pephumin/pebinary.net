### <i class="pe-anchor pe-fw"></i> The answer

Membership is free. And we welcome everyone who would like to paticipate with our surveys.

It is very easy to become a member, just simply click the `Sign up` menu and follow a few steps.

Please see below for the detailed information about registration process.


#### User sign up

You will be prompted for your name, email address, and the desired password. If the requested user email is not registered in our database, your account will then be created which will allow you to log in using your email address and password.


The process itself is very straightforward, and therefore expect no mistakes for registering new account except on the fact that particular user is already registered in our system. If this is a case, just simply use the `Password recovery` function to reset your password.

If, after logging in, you don't see the surveys you expect, contact your survey administrator for further assistance." %}
