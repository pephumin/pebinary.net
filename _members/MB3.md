## My tools

In this area, you'll find links to get help as well as logout. Your survey administrator may also have given you access to these tools:

Change my profile: This tool allows you to change your personal information, including your name and email address.
Change my password: This tool allows you to change your password. To ensure that only you change your password, you must enter your current password, as well as your desired new password.
E-mail support: This tool opens up an email composition window directly to the survey administrator.
