### <i class="pe-anchor pe-fw"></i> The answer

This help page is available both before and after logging in: the link labeled "Help" always brings you here. The links in the menu to the left allow you to navigate within this page. The "Back to Top" link after each section will take you to the top of the page, from which you can select additional menu links.

Remember, you can always contact your survey administrator for further information.
