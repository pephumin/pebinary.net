### <i class="pe-anchor pe-fw"></i> The answer

Yes we do.

Apart from member registration by email, we also have an option for a new member to get registered quickly by using one of their Social Network accounts. Currently we offer this service with one of the three Social Network players as follows.

- Registration by using Facebook
- Registration by using Google
- Registration by using Twitter


#### Registration by using Facebook

You will be prompted for your name, email address, and the desired password. If the requested user email is not registered in our database, your account will then be created which will allow you to log in using your email address and password.


#### Registration by using Google

You will be prompted for your name, email address, and the desired password. If the requested user email is not registered in our database, your account will then be created which will allow you to log in using your email address and password.


#### Registration by using Twitter

You will be prompted for your name, email address, and the desired password. If the requested user email is not registered in our database, your account will then be created which will allow you to log in using your email address and password.


The process itself is very straightforward, and therefore expect no mistakes for registering new account except on the fact that particular user is already registered in our system. If this is a case, just simply use the `Password recovery` function to reset your password.
