If your survey administrator has created public surveys (which do not require you to log in to take) and wants them to be shown, then they are available in the box labeled `Public Surveys`.

You can just simply click on any of the links in order to participate that particular survey.

Only registered user will be able to view and participate with these `Public Surveys`. Therefore, it is very important you log in to the system before start looking for them.


Once you log in, you will have the opportunity to take the public surveys.

By logging in first, your responses to the public survey will be identified as yours, which will then appear in your survey history, and more importantly it will also record for your point collection more accurately.
