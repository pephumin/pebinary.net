If the survey administrator allows you to save a survey, you will see a "Save" button at the bottom of each page in your survey. When you click the save button, the survey system remembers your responses so that you may return to the survey at a later time to complete it.

When you return to the survey, the survey system will automatically fill in your previous answers and allow you to pick up from where you left off.
