#### Cross analysis

To cross analyse results from a survey choose a question by selecting the appropriate radio button to the left of the question.

Cross tabulation returns a result set based on a two question selection. This is achieved by choosing which question's options will form the rows or columns for the cross tabulated result set.

Alternatively we can cross tabulate the same 2 questions but set question 4 as the row selection and question 1 as the column selection as shown below:




This produces the following result set:
