#### Give your survey a proper information

Enter a name for the survey in the name field. Do not use spaces in this name, think of this as a filename. Underscore's are acceptable.

Choose a group to own this survey. Unless you are creating a survey as root, you will only be permitted to choose the group of which you are a member.

Fill out the title, subtitle, and info fields. These fields will be used in the creation of a header for the final survey.

If you would like to be emailed a copy of each submitted survey, enter a valid email address in the email field. Leave this BLANK, unless your data needs to be backed up.

If you would like to theme your survey select the appropriate theme from the dropdown list. This will establish a link to a specific css style sheet for your survey. To design a theme please refer to the section: Themes.

The Confirmation Page is the page users will be shown after filling out the survey online. Fill in the heading and body text for the this page, or leave them blank to use the default.

Click continue, or click the Questions tab at the top to proceed to the questions section.
