#### The availability of raw data

Similar to traditional research, we also provide you with the raw data which you can then use for further result analysis on your own. Raw data  can be made available in a few different formats of your choice including:

* Tab delimited format
* Comma delimited format

##### Tab delimited format

Tab delimited format or as commonly known as ASCII format in which each field of text in the data file is separated by using the <kbd>[TAB]</kbd> character.

##### Comma delimited format

Comma delimited format or as commonly known as CSV format in which each field of text in the data file is separated by using the comma character <kbd>[,]</kbd>.
