Yes we do.

Apart from member registration by email, we also have an option for a new member to get registered quickly by using one of their Social Network accounts. Currently we offer this service with one of the three Social Network players as follows.

- Registration by using Facebook
- Registration by using Google
- Registration by using Twitter
