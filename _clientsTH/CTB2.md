### <i class="pe-anchor pe-fw"></i> The answer

Shows a preview of your survey. You can switch to this tab at any time to see what your survey will look like. If you would like to make changes, go back to the appropriate tab and make the changes. If you are satisfied with the survey, click the Finish tab or button at the bottom of the page.

{% include 1/alert.html type = "pe" close = "yes" icon = "exclamation-triangle" intro = "Note" msg = "The Next Page and Submit Survey buttons are inactive in the preview mode." %}
