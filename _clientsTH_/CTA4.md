On this tab, you can change define conditions on questions, so a question is only shown when a condition is met.

All conditions are "OR" conditions, so if one conditions is fulfilled, the question is shown.

A question that has a condition must be on the next page than the question/value that is used to compare it with. Use the "Order tab" to insert a section break where wanted (this is NOT done automatically).

Tip: a Yes/No question can only be compared using the values `Yes` or `No`.
